# Features 3, 4, 5 - Implementation Complete

## âœ… Feature 3: Enhanced Collaboration & Agent Communication

### What It Does
Enables agents to synthesize findings from multiple sources, identifying connections between market events and portfolio holdings for complex queries.

### Implementation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/nodes/collaboration_node.py` - NEW: Synthesis agent
- `src/graph/workflow.py` - UPDATED: Added collaboration routing
- `src/state/graph_state.py` - UPDATED: Added `collaboration_findings` field

**How It Works:**

1. **Collaboration Detection**: After market agent runs, system checks if collaboration is needed
2. **Triggers**: Queries mentioning BOTH market events AND portfolio impact
3. **Synthesis**: Collaboration agent receives portfolio + market data, creates unified analysis
4. **Output**: Replaces response with synthesized version

**Example Flow:**

```
User: "How does Microsoft news affect my portfolio?"

â†’ Planner: Needs portfolio + market
â†’ Portfolio Agent: "You own 25 shares of MSFT..."
â†’ Market Agent: "MSFT up 5% on partnership news..."
â†’ Collaboration Agent: "Your MSFT holdings gained ~$125 (5% of $2,500 value).
   This represents 3.2% of your total portfolio..."
â†’ Validator: Validates
â†’ Response shown
```

**Routing Logic:**

```python
def needs_collaboration(state):
    # Check if query mentions market events + portfolio
    has_market = any(["news", "announcement", "partnership", ...] in query)
    has_portfolio = any(["my portfolio", "affect me", ...] in query)
    has_both_data = portfolio_data and market_data exist

    return (has_market and has_portfolio) or has_both_data
```

## âœ… Feature 4: Session Management & Conversation History

### What It Does
Maintains conversation context across multiple queries, enabling follow-up questions and references to previous responses.

### Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/state/graph_state.py` - Added `conversation_history` field
- `src/nodes/planner_node.py` - Uses history for context
- `src/graph/workflow.py` - Accepts `conversation_history` parameter

**How It Works:**

1. **History Storage**: Last 5 Q&A pairs stored in `conversation_history`
2. **Context Passing**: History passed to planner for query interpretation
3. **Reference Resolution**: Planner can resolve references like "the first one", "that stock"
4. **Session Management**: Each client has separate history (in Streamlit session_state)

**History Format:**

```python
conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What stocks do I own?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "You own AAPL (50 shares), MSFT (25 shares)..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about the first one"},
    ...
]
```

**Example Flow:**

```
Query 1: "What stocks do I own?"
Response: "You own AAPL (50 shares), MSFT (25 shares), TSLA (10 shares)"
[Saved to history]

Query 2: "What's the performance of the first one?"
â†’ Planner sees "first one" + history â†’ knows it's AAPL
â†’ Market Agent fetches AAPL data
â†’ Response: "AAPL (your first holding) is at $178.50..."
```

**Usage in Planner:**

```python
if conversation_history:
    history_context = "\n\nPrevious Conversation:\n"
    for msg in conversation_history[-3:]:  # Last 3 interactions
        history_context += f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content'][:200]}...\n"
    # Added to planning prompt
```

## âœ… Feature 5: Enhanced Validation & Clarification Requests

### What It Does
Detects ambiguous queries, requests clarification, and performs enhanced fact-checking to prevent hallucinations.

### Implementation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/tools/validator_tools.py` - Added 3 new functions:
  - `detect_ambiguity()` - Finds vague references
  - `enhanced_fact_check()` - Cross-checks facts
  - `check_data_sufficiency()` - Verifies data availability
- `src/nodes/validator_node.py` - Uses enhanced validation
- `src/state/graph_state.py` - Added `needs_clarification`, `clarification_message`

**Ambiguity Detection:**

Catches:
- Vague pronouns: "it", "that stock", "that one"
- Relative terms: "best", "worst", "top" (without context)
- Time references: "recent", "lately" (without timeframe)
- Incomplete comparisons: "compared to" (missing items)

**Fact-Checking:**

1. **Ticker Verification**: Checks mentioned tickers exist in data
2. **Price Validation**: Verifies prices are reasonable (within 50% of actual)
3. **Contradiction Detection**: Flags contradictory statements
4. **Data Source Verification**: Ensures claims match source data

**Example Flows:**

### Ambiguous Query:
```
User: "How's that stock doing?"
â†’ Validator detects "that stock" without context
â†’ Returns clarification request
â†’ UI shows: "Which stock are you referring to? You own: AAPL, MSFT, TSLA"
User: "AAPL"
â†’ System reruns with "How is AAPL doing?"
```

### Hallucination Detection:
```
Response: "Your GOOGL holdings are up 5%"
Portfolio: [AAPL, MSFT, TSLA] (no GOOGL)
â†’ Validator detects: "Mentions tickers not in available data: GOOGL"
â†’ Adds warning to response
```

### Insufficient Data:
```
User: "What's the price of XYZ?"
â†’ Validator checks: XYZ not in portfolio or market data
â†’ Returns: "I don't have market data for XYZ. Would you like me to search for it?"
```

**Validation Flow:**

```python
def validator_node(state):
    # Step 1: Check ambiguity FIRST
    if detect_ambiguity(query):
        return needs_clarification=True

    # Step 2: Check data sufficiency
    if not check_data_sufficiency(query, data):
        return response="Missing data message"

    # Step 3: Fact-check response
    if enhanced_fact_check(response) has issues:
        add warning to response

    # Step 4: Original validation
    if not is_valid:
        add disclaimer
```

## ðŸ“Š Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complex Query with Collaboration

```python
# User query
query = "How does the recent Microsoft partnership with OpenAI affect my portfolio?"

# Workflow
result = run_workflow(query, "CLT-001", conversation_history=[])

# Result
{
    "needs_portfolio": True,
    "needs_market": True,
    "collaboration_findings": {
        "synthesized": True,
        "portfolio_holdings_analyzed": 7,
        "market_data_points": 7
    },
    "response": "Your Microsoft (MSFT) holdings of 25 shares have increased in value by approximately $125 based on the 5% price increase following the OpenAI partnership announcement. This represents 3.2% of your total portfolio value. The partnership strengthens Microsoft's position in AI technologies...",
    "validated": True,
    "needs_clarification": False
}
```

### Example 2: Follow-up with History

```python
# First query
history = []
result1 = run_workflow("What stocks do I own?", "CLT-001", history)
# Response: "You own AAPL (50 shares), MSFT (25 shares), TSLA (10 shares)"

# Update history
history.append({"role": "user", "content": "What stocks do I own?"})
history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": result1["response"]})

# Follow-up query
result2 = run_workflow("Tell me about the first one", "CLT-001", history)
# Planner sees history, knows "first one" = AAPL
# Response: "AAPL (Apple Inc.) is your first holding with 50 shares..."
```

### Example 3: Clarification Request

```python
# Ambiguous query
result = run_workflow("How's that stock?", "CLT-001")

# Result
{
    "needs_clarification": True,
    "clarification_message": "Which specific stock are you referring to when you say 'that stock'?",
    "validated": False
}

# UI shows clarification, user responds "AAPL"
# Rerun with updated query
result2 = run_workflow("How is AAPL doing?", "CLT-001")
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Streamlit (app.py)

### Required Updates:

1. **Session State for History**:
```python
# Initialize session state
if f'history_{client_id}' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state[f'history_{client_id}'] = []

# Pass to workflow
conversation_history = st.session_state[f'history_{client_id}']
result = run_workflow(query, client_id, conversation_history)
```

2. **Handle Clarification Requests**:
```python
if result.get("needs_clarification"):
    st.warning("ðŸ¤” " + result["clarification_message"])
    # Show input for clarification
    clarification = st.text_input("Please clarify:")
    if clarification:
        # Rerun with enhanced query
        enhanced_query = f"{query} ({clarification})"
        result = run_workflow(enhanced_query, client_id, conversation_history)
```

3. **Update History After Response**:
```python
if not result.get("needs_clarification"):
    # Add to history
    history = st.session_state[f'history_{client_id}']
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": query})
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": result["response"]})

    # Keep only last 5 interactions (10 messages)
    st.session_state[f'history_{client_id}'] = history[-10:]
```

4. **Display Conversation History**:
```python
with st.expander("ðŸ“œ Conversation History"):
    history = st.session_state.get(f'history_{client_id}', [])
    for msg in history[-6:]:  # Show last 3 Q&A pairs
        role = "You" if msg["role"] == "user" else "Assistant"
        st.text(f"{role}: {msg['content'][:150]}...")
```

5. **Clear History Button**:
```python
if st.sidebar.button("Clear History"):
    st.session_state[f'history_{client_id}'] = []
    st.rerun()
```
